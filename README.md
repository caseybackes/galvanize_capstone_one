# Galvanize Capstone 1: EDA: Capital BikeShare Open Data 

The [Capital Bikeshare](https://capitalbikeshare.com) company rents bikes to its member customers and casual users in most metro areas of Washington DC. These bikes are equiped with basic tracking devices and accumulate a fair amount of data per ride. In this EDA excercise, we will perform some fairly basic statistical analyses focused on the assets (bikes) and the infrastructure (stations) central to the Capital Bikeshare business model, and make some well-informed and data-driven recommendations to the company.
